       Her debut, Holy Island, was released in 2015 and became an instant, international bestseller. Since then,
       more than twenty of her novels have gone on to take the coveted #1 spot, some even before general release 
       and whilst only available to ‘pre-order’. The Bookseller magazine has reported on Louise having topped 
       the ‘Most Read’ and ‘Most Sold’ fiction charts, and she has garnered an army of loyal fans who love her 
       atmospheric and addictive storytelling. <br><br>
       Her eleventh novel, ‘The Infirmary’, is a prequel story to the DCI Ryan series and is available as a major
       Audible Originals audio-drama starring Tom Bateman, Kevin Whately, Bertie Carvel, Hermione Norris and Alun Armstrong.
       The first novel in her Alexander Gregory Thrillers series, Impostor, was shortlisted in the British Book Awards 2020:
       Crime & Thriller Book of the Year. The audiobook of Impostor, narrated by Hugh Dancy, was also selected as a finalist
       in the New York Festivals Radio Awards, Best Fiction Audiobook of the Year Category.
       In May 2021, Louise was shortlisted for the prestigious Crime Writers’ Association ‘Dagger in the Library’ award, which 
       recognises an author’s entire body of work having been consistently enjoyed by library borrowers around the United Kingdom,
       and an author’s longstanding support of libraries. <br><br>
       Louise was born in Northumberland, England. She studied undergraduate and postgraduate Law at King’s College, University 
       of London and then abroad in Paris and Florence. She spent much of her working life in London, where she was a lawyer for
       a number of years until taking the decision to change career and pursue her dream to write. Now, she writes full time and
       lives with her husband and son in Northumberland and Edinburgh. She enjoys reading all manner of books, painting, travelling
       and spending time with family and friends. <br><br>
